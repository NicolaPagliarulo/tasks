## Installation

First you will need to clone the repo on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicolaPagliarulo/tasks.git
```
After that you will need to install the dependencies.
(You need to set up a virtual environment before proceeding)

```bash
python setup.py install
```

# Usage

## Running the 'traffic_estimation.py'
If the installation above went smoothly you can now go to the 'traffic_estimation.py' file and run it.
You can either set up a run configuration or use this command (replace the PATH_TO_TRAFFIC_ESTIMATION with your path)
Example - `python C:\python_projects\traffic_estimation\traffic_estimation.py`

```bash
python {PATH_TO_TRAFFIC_ESTIMATION}
```
